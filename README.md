# Godot Docs

An attempt to transform the original ``classes.xml`` file in **godot** engine into human-readable format using XSLT and other methods.

The main goals are:

* Original ``classes.xml`` file should remain untouched
* The files should be able to open in the browser directly

## Available Docs

View [classes_styled.xml](https://thumbline.github.io/godot_doc/doc/base/classes_styled.xml).
